          <h3>Why positions and floats?</h3>
          <p class="explanation-para">In css there are brilliant ways of manipulating your content. Using grid-layouts and flex-box, really can save you a lot of time and effort.</p>
          <p class="explanation-para">These are tools I plan to use heavily in the future. However seing as this was my first solo project, I think it's important to understand how and what the different properties do.</p>
          <p class="explanation-para">To manipulate my content "manually", forces me to learn what properties like positions, display, left, right, top, bottom, floats are used to style your content.</p>
          <p class="explanation-para">Once I understand this fully, I can better utilize and understand the benefits of flex-box and grid in the future.</p>

          <p class="explanation-para">There are several ways to structure your website. But in a nutshell I wanted to make sure that each page was structured with a header, body and a footer-section.</p>
          <p class="explanation-para">To illustrate this I mainly used the sections tag. This was just to keep things simple for myself.</p>
          <p class="explanation-para">In the future I plan to utilize more of the grid-layout. Using tags like article, main, header etc. to structure my website.</p>
